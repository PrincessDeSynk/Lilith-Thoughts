# Lilith-Thoughts

## Hi welcome!

This is the first entry into this entire "personal public journal" thing here but...I figured I'd introduce myself before anything else happens.

My name is Lilith, but if that's too difficult to remember just refer to me as Lily or Lyn. 
I'm a young girl attending a typical public school. Senior. 5th year. Post-secondary again soon.

Anyways, the entire Idea of this project is simply to give some insight on how I feel from a day to day basis. Blogger/Blogs in general are terrible to me. They require a following and knowledge, where as this project can be divided into just...If I share, or if you accidentally come across it and become intrigued about me and my story, then that's fair.

Let's move onto Chapters.

## Chapter 1: Liar (2021/October/8)

Today is another day. I've upset already one of my friends due to a slight change in my mannerisms. Apparently becoming confusing and ending with them completely frustrated at me due to how I word things in texts/messages differently.
It's not a mood change, or an identity crisis...I just can't handle acting the way I was, it felt like work. I feel like being forward and to the point. Strong I suppose.

Don't get me wrong I'm still soft, and I have my cute side...I'm definitely still a bottom/submissive girl when it comes to the right person...She's wonderful, but I'll get there later.

Lately our friend group appears to suffer due to some drama between me, and a "friend". I didn't tell her I was in a relationship therefore...she freaks out and tells me to "fuck off"...not the correct word or reaction you'd expect, now would you? Niether did I. However I assumed things had cooled down, she claimed to forgive me. Turns out her younger brother had lied to her and said someone standing beside me had called her brother a scumbag. To my knowledge this never happened, therefore it was news to me. 

Well the "friend" freaks out again, calls the fact that I had no memory or knowledge of this happening "horse crap" and tells me to rot in hell...I took that oppourtunity to block her on the spot. No more toxicity if I can help it. No need to suffer any more than I have. The scars I do my best to hide are proof of such things...With the one most important to me it's difficult. She's able to tell when things are clearly wrong with me, label off the fact of "No you're not okay, tell me what's wrong"...Yet others have trouble with such things. Maybe I loosen up because I feel attracted towards her but I still have an aura of mystery. I tend to separate myself so I can keep myself sane and in control. And with her being able to talk to me and say "I can tell you're not fine, what's wrong?" As I...in that moment am not okay? That's new. Different. Unique. I enjoy it in a way, having someone who can read you quite well is not normal for me. 

I have a friend I've known since we were very young. Before the double digits even. And even he still can't read me. 

I get with this beautiful, amazing, wonderful woman for hardly a year and yet she's managed to make me rethink people as a whole. Special. She's the best. And I don't think it'll ever leave my head of how well she can just...understand, to be able to see, and feel like that is impressive. Especially with me. Especially with how I've been hurt. I don't want to be a second without her, I feel bad going to class every day, to split ways in the halls...It's painful to my heart.

She knows how to fluster me, to take care of me, she can tell exactly when I'm clearly not okay. Even after I lie. More than once. 

I'm a liar. For a good cause however. 

I lie so I don't bother others with my issues, and sometimes...I lie because I am completely unsure of the answer to "tell me what's wrong". Because sometimes, I'm still gathering the words to throw it all together into a communicatable form. A way I can express it properly without sitting there, attempting to speak but to no avail. 

I don't lie all the time. Not about everything. But whenever you hear me say "I'm fine", "I'm alright", etc? I'm clearly not going to be. The words alone aren't enough either, the way I express those phrases are also important, cause I might actually be fine...But 90% of the time I could say "No I'm doing terribly"...So why don't I?

Because people don't need my issues, they don't need my drama. And they don't need to wait for me to piece together what's wrong with me.

I'm cursed...Scarred...hurt...and I feel empty. Except when I'm with her...She...fills that hole...And even though it's dangerous to depend on people for happiness...She does provide some of my smiles for me. I love her. But...how do I do it alone? What if I lose again? 

I tend to ignore the idea of losing, until it hits me in the face. 

I clutch my cure behind closed doors. 

One day, I'll be able to find the truth. 

If you're the one who's meant to be hun...if you're my soulmate...my final piece...then show me, heal me, protect me...I'll love you and be loyal to you, every single day. I promise. I love you.
