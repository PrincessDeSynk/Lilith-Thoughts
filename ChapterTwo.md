## Chapter 2: Worse

The people here are cruel

They looked down on me

They genuinely thought they were above me

> "WHAT'S WRONG LOSER? CAN'T GET UP?"

I started playing this game to escape from reality.

But whether in the game or in real life...

It's all the same.

Both worlds are filled with ***disgusting*** people--

Those who prey on the ***weak.***

So I thought to myself,

If you can't escape bad people...

Then all you have to do is be ***worse*** than them.

Give them a ***taste*** of their own medicine

***Show them what it's like.***
